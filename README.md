# Q-Learning-For-Tic-Tac-Toe

Implemented a Q-Learning algorithm in C++ to master the game of tic-tac-toe. The project involved training an intelligent agent against a random opponent, enabling it to learn and optimize its moves through reinforcement learning. Over time, the agent developed strategies to consistently win or draw, showcasing its ability to achieve optimal gameplay.
